microcontrollers are porgrammable with the C language or assembly codes which is difficult language users C/C++ which is much easier to learn and use.
 
The Arduino is a versatile electronic development platform so you can connect a huge variety of input 
and output device to it Breadboarding basics for the connecting components.
 The rows of a solderless breadboard are connected inside allowing you to connect components by plugging them into the same row as each other.
