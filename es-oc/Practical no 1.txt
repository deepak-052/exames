Overview of arduino and its capabilities 
The arduino is a development board for the ATMEGA micro computer.
There are other useful feature like Input\output pin a USB port communication between the arduino 
and a computer and a 9v DC power connector
one of the reason Arduino is so popular is that it is super easy to write Arduino code. Most 
microcontrollers are porgrammable with the C language or assembly codes which is difficult language users C/C++ which is much easier to learn and use.
 
The Arduino is a versatile electronic development platform so you can connect a huge variety of input 
and output device to it Breadboarding basics for the connecting components.
 The rows of a solderless breadboard are connected inside allowing you to connect components by plugging them into the same row as each other.
 The special long rails alnong the edges are for easy access to powder the ground.
